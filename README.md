Final Project: Statistical Modeling with Python
Objectives
Utilize APIs (CityBikes, FourSquare, Yelp) to access data.
Clean and preprocess data using Python.
Load the prepared data into a database via Python.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical methods and visualizations.
Analyze data trends and patterns with statistical models.
Build and evaluate predictive models based on the data.
Interpret and communicate the results of the statistical analysis.
Methodology
Register online accounts and acquire API keys.
Develop queries for API interaction.
Retrieve and store data for analysis.
Findings
Analyze and interpret the collected data.
Establish appropriate data storage solutions.
Clean and organize the data for further use.
Challenges
Working with the Foursquare and Yelp APIs presents unique obstacles:

Authentication and Rate Limits: Utilizing these services can incur significant costs due to restrictions and pricing models.
Data Completeness: Each API offers specific data; combining both provides more comprehensive options.
Data Structure and Navigation: Handling nested and complex responses, pagination, and size limits requires careful management.
Future Directions
Leverage Foursquare for location-based services, venue discovery, and global data coverage.
Use Yelp for detailed business reviews, ratings, and customer insights, particularly for U.S.-based analyses.
