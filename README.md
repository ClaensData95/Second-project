# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals

- Accessing data using APIs (CityBikes, FourSquare, Yelp)
- Cleaning and transforming data using Python
- Loading data into a database using Python
- Performing EDA, including using both statistics and visualizations
- Identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models
- Building a Model and further evaluation of the data.
- Interpreting the results of the statistical models

## Process
- Create accounts online and obtain API Keys
- Prepare queries for the APIs
- Query and store the data for further usage

## Results

- Review and analyze the data
- Create data storages
- Clean up and store the data

## Challenges 
Integrating and using Foursquare and Yelp APIs comes with its own set of challenges.

Here's a comparison of the common issues developers may face with each API:

- Authentication and Rate Limits - using the services is costly
- Data Completeness - each API has its own scope, combination of both brings more choices
- Data Structure and Usage - complex and nested, handling pagination and response size limits

## Future Goals

I would choose Foursquare focusing on location-based services, venue exploration, or global coverage.

I would use Yelp for detailed business reviews, ratings, and customer insights, especially in the U.S.
